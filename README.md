## ecommerce-api-with-fastapi


Welcome to the ecommerce API developed with FastAPI! This API has been designed to allow users to perform various ecommerce related tasks such as searching for products, adding items to a cart, and placing orders.

To ensure the reliability and performance of the API, I will be implementing several software development methodologies including logging, caching, and testing.

Logging will be implemented to track the various events that occur within the API and to provide useful information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Caching will be implemented to improve the performance of the API by storing frequently accessed data in a redis memory for faster retrieval.

Tests will be implemented to verify the correct functioning of the API and to ensure that new changes do not introduce any regressions.

I hope that you find this API useful and I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you ðŸ˜€
